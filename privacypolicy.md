# 1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how Guardify (“the Bot”) collects, uses, and safeguards information when used on Discord servers. By using the Bot, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

# 2. Information We Collect
- User Identifiers: User IDs, usernames, and profile images as provided by Discord.
- Message Content: Content of messages that are scanned or logged as part of the moderation process. **Message content isn't and never will be stored on our database.**
- Moderation Data: Records of strikes, warnings, violations, and other moderation actions stored in our database.
- Interaction Data: Information related to commands and feedback provided by users.

# 3. How We Use Your Information
- Moderation: To detect and remove content that violates server guidelines or Discord policies.
- Logging and Reporting: To maintain records of moderation actions and provide server administrators with moderation reports.
- Service Improvement: To analyze usage and improve the functionality and effectiveness of the Bot.
- Third-Party Integration: To send content to external services (e.g., OpenAI’s moderation API) solely for the purpose of evaluating content against harmful standards.

# 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure
- Within Discord: Information is used internally for moderation and is accessible only to server administrators and authorized personnel.
- Third Parties: We do not sell or rent your personal information. Data may be shared with third-party services (like OpenAI) only as necessary for the moderation process.
- Legal Requests: We may disclose your information if required by law or in response to legal requests.
  
# 5. Data Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
Message content is only sent for scanning by AI and is never stored.

# 6. Data Retention
Moderation and logging data is retained for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or as required by applicable laws.

# 7. Your Rights
- Access: You have the right to access the information we hold about you.
- Correction: If you believe any information is inaccurate, please contact the developer to request a correction.
- Deletion: Requests for deletion of your data may be considered, subject to any legal obligations to retain certain records.
# 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of this document. Your continued use of the Bot after such changes will constitute your acceptance of the revised policy.
